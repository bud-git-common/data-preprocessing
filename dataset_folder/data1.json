Place 5 ounces processed mushrooms in a large bowl; set remaining 12 ounces mushrooms aside for mushroom duxelles.\nAdd ground beef, panko, egg, Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 teaspoon thyme, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper to the bowl with the 5 ounces of mushrooms. Mix with your hands or a spoon until well combined. Turn beef mixture out onto a piece of wax paper, and shape into a 5x10-inch rectangular loaf.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and place an elevated wire rack onto the baking sheet.\nPlace 2 shallots into the same food processor and pulse until finely chopped.\nFor mushroom duxelles, melt butter In a skillet over medium-high heat. Add reserved 12 ounces mushrooms, minced shallots, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon thyme and cook, stirring, until mushrooms have released their liquid, about 10 minutes. Add sherry and cook until liquid is evaporated. Turn off heat and let mixture cool. Season with salt and pepper.\nUnfold a sheet of puff pastry. Puff pastry comes folded in thirds; cut off one of the short ends at the 1/3 mark, and reserve to make lattice (optional). Roll out the larger piece of puff pastry on a lightly-floured surface into a 13x15-inch rectangle, which will be large enough to wrap the beef loaf on all sides.\nLeaving a 1-inch border uncovered, place prosciutto slices, slightly overlapping, evenly onto the puff pastry to cover. Spread mustard evenly over prosciutto. Spread mushroom duxelles evenly over mustard layer.\nCenter beef loaf crosswise on top of pastry rectangle. Bring in the sides of the puff pastry, pinching edges together. Bring top and bottom edges of puff pastry together and fold to seal beef loaf completely inside. Brush pastry with beaten egg yolk.\nOptional lattice: roll out the reserved 1/3 sheet puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Using a lattice cutter or a sharp paring knife, cut approximately 1-inch slits in the puff pastry in parallel lines about 1 inch apart, with each line of cuts offset from the adjacent line of cuts by about 1/2 inch. Gently spread the lattice-cut pastry and place over the top of pastry-wrapped loaf. Brush lattice with remaining beaten egg yolk.\nPlace pastry-wrapped loaf on the rack on top of the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), 30 to 45 minutes. Allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing with a serrated knife.",

Tip into the marinade and mix so it\u2019s completely coated. Cover, chill and marinate for at least 1 hr or up to 24 hrs \u2013 the longer, the better.\nThread all the chicken onto two skewers so that both skewers go through each piece of meat, packing down tightly as you go to make a compact kebab (see tip, below).\nLight a lidded barbecue, and let the flames die down. Once the coals have turned ashen, pile them up on one side with a single layer of coals scattered around the other side. Lay the chicken kebab on the side of the barbecue with only a few coals underneath. Put the lid down and cook for 45 mins, turning every 15 mins. To finish, lift the lid and roll the kebab over to the hotter side to char the meat, turning it every few minutes until well browned and cooked through. Prise the chicken pieces apart in the centre to check they\u2019re cooked, or use a digital cooking thermometer \u2013 it should read 70C or more. Leave to rest for 5-10 mins while you cook the pittas (see recipe, opposite). Bring the kebab to the table and carve into thin slices with a serrated knife. Pile the carved meat into the warm pittas, then the sliced red onions and tomatoes, chips and tzatziki (see our recipes, below).",
